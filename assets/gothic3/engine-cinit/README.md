# Engine CRT initializer evidence

This package records the next dependency after Engine environment-vector return.
It captures 26 original bodies (566 instructions), the caller at `30677284`,
the floating-point callback at `30892ac0`, and two original initializer tables.
The C initializer table has 200 slots with 6 nonzero entries. The C++ table has
93,705 slots with 1,963 nonzero entries; omitted entries are verified zero.

Generate from the matching offline study:

The generator checks the original Engine.dll hash and exact caller bytes.
Independent regeneration produced identical JSON, SHA-256

The capture's `runtimeConnected: false` records evidence preparation; it grants
no execution authority. The TypeScript continuation separately obtains a
private permit from the actually reached Engine startup caller.
The captured bodies cover the readonly image guard, floating-point setup,
pointer encoding, C initializer walker and exit registration. The individual
C++ callback implementations and their downstream dependencies remain work.
The selected continuation now executes the readonly guard contract, original
floating-point conversion setup, divide dispatch, ten-pointer encoding loop,
and C initializer walker. Its first callback allocates and publishes the
128-byte CRT exit table, including the original failure result of 24. The normal
path also initializes the stream table at `3067c3c7`, including its 20-entry
allocation retry and failure result of 26. It links the original 20 static FILE
records and reads the existing Engine I/O blocks under their retained owner.
The SSE2 callback at `3067f720` executes its original ID-toggle and CPUID logic
using the retained virtual CPU selection. Its normal execution probe contract
copies XMM1 into XMM0 and returns one; the contract's internal instructions are
excluded from the executed-source count. Missing selections or an unsupported
SIMD exception retain the actual pending instruction. Zero feature results take
the original zero-return path. The normal path stops at `30685007`.
Initializer completion and campaign
activation remain unfinished.

Use retained Engine ownership when implementing these routines; captured
addresses identify original locations and cannot serve as browser pointers.

The fourth C initializer reads the retained argument multibyte-ready image.
Its ready branch returns normally; a cleared flag preserves the pending original
setup call. The fifth initializer reruns the original CPU helper and publishes its own
SSE2 control global. The sixth initializer pushes shutdown callback `30671144` and enters the original
exit-registration wrapper and onexit routine. Execution stops at its pending
EH4 prolog `3067e500`, after 1,551 admitted operations.

The sixth initializer is absent from the original disassembly and function CSV.
Its exact pinned PE bytes are decoded with Capstone 5.0.7, with decoder provenance
in the receipt. Install that version or supply `--capstone-path <library-root>`.
The onexit scope includes its 16-byte header and 12-byte handler record; its
original bytes are checked as immutable storage. Registration is not complete.
